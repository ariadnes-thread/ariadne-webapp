# Ariadne's Thread webapp

This project uses [Create React App (CRA)](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) for all of the house-keeping. Check out its [User Guide](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md) for more info on how CRA works, its useful features, and general React advice. 

This webapp uses [Bulma framework](https://bulma.io/) for all CSS styling. 

# Building & running

You'll need to create a `src/config.json` to build/run the app. An example config has been provided for you at `src/config.example.json`. Use `npm start` to run the app locally (with hot-reloading) and `npm run build` to generate a static HTML build in the `build/` folder.
